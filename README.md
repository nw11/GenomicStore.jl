# GenomicStore
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nw11/GenomicStore.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nw11/GenomicStore.jl)

This module is a place to put various Julia functions I need to utilise HDF5 as a store for genomic tracks. The master branch is composed of things that work for me for a specific application, a better structured reorganisation of this code lies on this branch.

GenomicStore aims to provides a convenient structure for accessing and storing genome annotation "tracks".

This is provided by interfacing with a [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) data store.
